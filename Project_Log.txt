The last few days i have been in contact with Mchales to further nail down what they would like to get from this FYP.
Next step for this week is to connect Esp32 and start getting used to using it. Going on from this I plan to start 
reading "Dummy" Can hex values from a csv file in the coming days...

30/10/2019 Github Initialised.

Two more questions asked of McHales...
1.What CAN transceiver are you using? is there any libraries available?
2.How do you test your communication between Isocan and the ECU?

Starting today I am going to work with the Esp32 as this will be the medium to take in my CAN info and decipher it.

Today I received two CAN Transceivers from Amazon. I will begin usimg these by following the following tutorial: 
http://www.iotsharing.com/2017/09/how-to-use-arduino-esp32-can-interface.html
I believe this will be a good place to start...
Plan is to aim to have the two esp32's talking for xmas with one being the slave and the other the master. This would be 
good prototyping before I use an actual vehicle CAN Bus.

This morning I got two esp32's talking via CAN using SN65HVD230 CAN module. I followed the code used in this tutorial to get it working initially:

This tutorial sends over a lowercase string from one can to another.. this can then interprets the string and converts it to uppercase and then 
sends it back.
