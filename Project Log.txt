30/10/2019 Week 44: 

The last few days i have been in contact with Mchales to further nail down what they would like to get from this FYP.
Next step for this week is to connect Esp32 and start getting used to using it. Going on from this I plan to start 
reading "Dummy" Can hex values from a csv file in the coming days...

30/10/2019 Github Initialised.

05/11/2019 week 45: 
Two more questions asked of McHales...
1.What CAN transceiver are you using? is there any libraries available?
2.How do you test your communication between Isocan and the ECU?

Starting today I am going to work with the Esp32 as this will be the medium to take in my CAN info and decipher it.
